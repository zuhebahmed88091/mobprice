The battery capacity is expected to remain the same, 5,000 mAh. There’s no official word on the wireless charging for the Pro model (was 67W on the original).</p><p>Note that the tweet specifically mentions the Xiaomi 11T Pro, so the vanilla T-phone will probably miss out on the upgrade. The original 11 charged at 55W over a wire and 50W wirelessly. There were also the Mi 11X and 11X Pro, though those were lower end models and charged at 33W.</p><p>Anyway, Xiaomi already used 120W on the Mi 10 Ultra (though not the Mi 11 Ultra) and later the Mix 4 (and two Black Shark 4 models).</p><p>According to unconfirmed information, the Xiaomi 11T Pro will be powered by a Snapdragon 888 chipset, same as the original 11 Pro. The vanilla 11T, however, is expected to switch to a MediaTek Dimensity chip. Both should have 120 Hz displays like their predecessors.</p><p>We’ve already seen some leaked euro pricing for the 11T series, though we won’t know the official price tags until Wednesday next week.</p>', 'news1631099617.jpg', 'Active', '2021-09-08 11:13:37', '2021-09-08 11:13:37'),
